= Creating Dynamic Lines with ThreeJS

```
var geometry, line, lineMaterial,
     MAX_LINE_POINTS = 100000;

lineMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
	color: window.myoManager.hands[myoId].myoId.colour
});

geometry = new THREE.Geometry();
for (i=0; i < MAX_LINE_POINTS; i++){
	geometry.vertices.push(new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0));
}

line = new THREE.Line(geometry, lineMaterial);
line.geometry.dynamic = true;

scene.add(line);'
```

Now, when you want to add more vertices to the line, it's as simple as three steps:

```
// shift the array
line.geometry.vertices.push(line.geometry.vertices.shift()); 
//add the point to the end of the array
line.geometry.vertices[100000-1] = new THREE.Vector3(newPoint); 
line.geometry.verticesNeedUpdate = true;
```
