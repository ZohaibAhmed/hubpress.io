= Creating Dynamic Lines with ThreeJS

`var geometry, line, lineMaterial,
     MAX_LINE_POINTS = 100000;

lineMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
	color: window.myoManager.hands[myoId].myoId.colour
});

geometry = new THREE.Geometry();
for (i=0; i < MAX_LINE_POINTS; i++){
	geometry.vertices.push(new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0));
}

line = new THREE.Line(geometry, lineMaterial);
line.geometry.dynamic = true;

scene.add(line);'


Now, when you want to add more vertices to the line, it's as simple as three steps:

'line.geometry.vertices.push(myo_manager.myoId.currentLine.geometry.vertices.shift()); // shift the array
line.geometry.vertices[100000-1] = new THREE.Vector3(myo_manager.cube.position.x, myo_manager.cube.position.y, 0); //add the point to the end of the array
line.geometry.verticesNeedUpdate = true;`
